ZenMoney is a personal finance management platform designed to streamline the process of tracking expenses, managing budgets, and gaining insights into financial behaviour. The system provides core functionalities such as transaction logging, category-wise expense visualization, financial goal tracking, and user account management, aiming to reduce manual bookkeeping and empower users with actionable insights. It is built with a clean, modular architecture that supports both backend processing and intuitive frontend interaction. The frontend of ZenMoney is developed using Angular 12.2.18, delivering a responsive and interactive user experience with real-time toast alerts, dynamic charts, and structured financial dashboards. On the backend, the application leverages Spring Boot 3.4.5 and Java 21 to implement business logic and expose secure, RESTful APIs. A MySQL 8.0 database is used for persistent storage of user data, transactions, categories, and authentication details. Security is enforced through JWT-based authentication and role-based access control, enabling users to securely manage their accounts and data. Features such as customizable spending categories, recurring transaction support, password recovery, and analytics-driven dashboards enhance the user experience and financial clarity. Developing ZenMoney deepened my expertise in full-stack application development, especially in crafting secure, scalable web solutions that integrate modern frontend frameworks with robust backend systems.
